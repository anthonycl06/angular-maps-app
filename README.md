Don't use Angular CLI directly (unless the environment variables are created), because the environment variables are created based on the .env

## Steps:
1. Clone .env.template y rename it to .env
2. Fill the environment variables
3. Create Angular Envs (optional)
```
npm run envs
```

4. For development execute:
```
npm run start
```

5. For production execute:
```
npm run build
```
